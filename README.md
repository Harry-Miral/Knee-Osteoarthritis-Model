# Knee-Osteoarthritis-Model

All data is saved in the Datasets directory. Please use the ZIP decompression tool to decompress it. Due to size limitations, the complete original image is placed in two folders. For your convenience, it is recommended that you manually put all the images decompressed from image2.zip into the path decompressed from image.zip. Run train.py to get the results directly.
